# BikeStoreSalesDashboard

This repository contains an Excel dashboard for analyzing global bike store sales and customer insights. The dashboard includes visualizations for sales trends, customer demographics, and product performance.

## Project Overview

This project involved several key steps to transform raw data into a comprehensive and insightful Excel dashboard. Below are the steps and processes undertaken to achieve this:

### Data Handling and Preparation

1. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Removed duplicates and handled missing values to ensure data integrity.
   - Standardized formatting across all columns for consistency.

2. **Data Enhancement:**
   - Added new calculated columns for Age Group, Profit, and Revenue.
   - Categorized customers into relevant age groups to better understand demographic trends.

### Creating the Dashboard with Excel and Pivot Tables

1. **Leveraging Pivot Tables:**
   - Used pivot tables to efficiently summarize and analyze large datasets.
   - Created dynamic views to explore various aspects of the data, such as sales trends, customer demographics, and product performance.
   - Pivot tables allowed for quick reorganization of data to find useful insights without the need for complex formulas.

2. **Designing Visualizations:**
   - Utilized Excel's charting tools to design various charts and graphs that represent the summarized data visually.
   - Included line charts, bar charts, and pie charts to display key insights clearly and effectively.
   - Ensured that visualizations are interactive and easy to interpret, enhancing the overall analytical experience.

3. **Adding Interactive Filters:**
   - Integrated slicers for easy filtering of data by Year, Gender, Age Group, and Country.
   - Enabled interactive exploration of the data, allowing users to drill down into specific segments and time periods.
   - Slicers enhanced the interactivity of pivot tables, making the dashboard user-friendly and dynamic.
